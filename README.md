### Hi there, I'm Amit 👋
**AI Solution Engineer & Automation Expert**

I specialize in building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between AI capabilities and real-world business needs. My focus is on robust architecture, security, and practical implementation of Agents (RAG/MCP).

🚀 **What I'm working on:**
* **[LinkedIn Brain Node](https://github.com/Amitro123/LinkedIn-KnowledgeBase):** An autonomous RAG system turning saved posts into an active knowledge base using Gemini 2.5 Flash.
* **[GitHub Automation Agent](https://github.com/Amitro123/automation-service):** A CI/CD orchestration tool integrating Anthropic's **MCP** for intelligent code reviews and self-healing documentation.
* **[AI LinkedIn Post Generator](https://github.com/Amitro123/ai-linkedin-post-generator):** A multi-agent system (CrewAI) with 5 specialized agents that orchestrate viral Hebrew content generation. Built with Python & Reflex.

#### 🛠️ Developer Tools & Infrastructure
* **[AutoFix Python Engine](https://github.com/Amitro123/autofix-python-engine):** An intelligent debugging tool using Gemini 2.0 with function calling for contextual analysis, variable tracing, and RAG-based fixes.
* **[V-Shell (GitVoice)](https://github.com/Amitro123/V-Shell):** A voice-controlled shell assistant for hands-free Git operations, leveraging LLMs and advanced Speech-to-Text technology.

#### 🌐 Full Stack & Integrations
* **[EventPulse](https://github.com/Amitro123/EventPulse):** A live event discovery platform integrated directly with the Ticketmaster API.
